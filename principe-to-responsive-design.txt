Basic responsive design principles
1.Fluid grids and layouts - To allow content to easily adapt to the current 
viewport width used to browse the website. Uses % rather than px for all
layout related lengths.
2.Flexible/responsive images - Images behave differently than text content
and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport.
3.Media queries - To change styles on a certain viewport widths(breakpoint),
allowing us to create diferent versions of our website for different widths.
